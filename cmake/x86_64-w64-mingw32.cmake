# Setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH in the way we do below forces CMake to look
# for other files/packages/libraries etc. ONLY under CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH.
# Usually this is the right thing, because it prevents accidentally finding
# something meant for another platform.  However, you may have other stuff,
# for instance Boost, that you want to use but which you don't want to
# install in /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.  Therefore, we use a variable,
# LOCAL_FIND_ROOT, to allow other paths to be included as the root of a
# search tree.
